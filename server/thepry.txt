GRAPHQL-> query lang -> APIS -> runtime 
-> exisitnf data 
-> FB -> it allows client to ask exactly what data is required 

Kye concepts :
/api/book/1 -> fixed 



1 Query Based -> Query send to server -> response with exact data ->  no fixed response no 
2 Single end point -> /graphql -> data we want will be defined in the request 
3 schema-based -> strongly based ->expose schema 
eg type Book{ -> client requirment 
id:Int,
title:String
}
4 Resolvers -> function that tells GRAPHQL how to fetch that data for a particular field
//filter 
5 mutations-> Write update delete -> mutations
mutation{
addBook(title:"DONE"......){
id 
title
}


REST  VS GRAPHQL 

no multiple end points 
overfetching -> avoided 
underfetching -> avioided 
api ->  versions -> no versioning because of the scehma
